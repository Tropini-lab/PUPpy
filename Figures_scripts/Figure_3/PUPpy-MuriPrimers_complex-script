# Code and instructions to generate Muribaculaceae-specific primers for the complex stool samples.

# Gather the CDS files of all 167 members used to generate Muribaculaceae-specific primers. Table S1 indicates the sources of all 156 non-targets and 11 Muribaculaceae targets.

# Activate Conda environment
conda activate puppy

# Align CDS files of all 167 members
## The folder 'Muri_CDSes' contains all the CDS files of the 11 Muribaculaceae targets and the folder 'nonTarget_complex_CDSes' contains the 156 CDS files used for specificity checks
puppy-align -pr Muri_CDSes -nt nonTarget_complex_CDSes -o Complex_Align_OUT

# Identify CDSes conserved across the Muribaculaceae targets.
puppy-primers -pr Muri_CDSes -i Complex_Align_OUT/ResultDB.tsv -o Complex_Muri_primers -s 125 175 -optm 56

# Conserved CDS(es) were further inspected to manually design a Muribaculaceae-specific primer cocktail, as described in the PUPpy paper.
